## 🧠 My Research Pipeline (Brand Story)

This GitHub represents my **scientific pipeline** — how I think, work, and translate ideas into outcomes:

**Question → Hypothesis → Experiment → Analysis → Validation → Impact**

* 🔍 **Biological Question:** Cancer mechanisms, immune responses, therapeutic targets
* 🧪 **Wet-Lab Exploration:** Cell culture, immunology assays, molecular biology
* 🧬 **Computational Support:** Bioinformatics, molecular modeling, simulations
* 📊 **Data Interpretation:** Statistical and biological relevance
* 🔁 **Iteration & Validation:** Refining hypotheses using evidence
* 🌍 **Impact:** Translational insights for biotech & pharma applications

## 🔬 About Me

I am a **biotechnology master’s student at Northeastern University**, having completed **one year of graduate training**, with a strong foundation in **wet-lab and translational research**, complemented by **computational biology and drug discovery tools**.

My academic and research journey over the past five years spans **cancer biology, immunology, molecular techniques, and computational analysis**. I enjoy asking *why biological systems behave the way they do* and *how that knowledge can be converted into therapies or technologies that serve patient health needs*.

I am currently **actively seeking co-op or internship opportunities** in the **biotech or pharmaceutical industry**, where I can contribute as a motivated scientist while continuing to learn from real-world R&D environments.
